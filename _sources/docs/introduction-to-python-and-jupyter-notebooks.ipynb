    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the online materials for this online course on programming in Python for mathematical computing (a.k.a. *scientific computing*).\n",
    "\n",
    "This first unit is an introduction to some basic features of the Python software that we will be using.\n",
    "Specifically, we use Python 3, and even more specifically, Python version 3.7 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start directly with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks via the tool *JupyterLab* as a way to use Python interactively like a scientific calculator, and aim to work with these notebooks as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we will also learn the more advanced code development tools offered by the *Integrated Development Environment* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/).\n",
    "This supports both both interactive use of Python and also working with files of Python code: creating, opening and editing files, running and debugging code, and so on.\n",
    "It has more advanced tools for developing Python code than the Jupyter notebook system, so for more substantial programming tasks it can be better to develop code within Spyder — even if that code is then transferrred into a notebook for final presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the use of any Integrated Development Environment [\"IDE\"] is somewhat optional; it will be possible to work almost entirely with Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "That for example would allow working with just the web-browser based system [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aside:** There are other IDE's for Python, such as [IDLE](https://realpython.com/python-idle/); that is the original IDE for Python and is pre-installed in some computers (Mac's at least) but it is very rudimentary compared to Spyder."
