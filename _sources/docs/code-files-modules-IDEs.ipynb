    "So far, we have worked on each topic within a single Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "However, in some stuations it is better to put some Python code into a separate file, sometimes called a *module*, and then either execute that code directly, or access it from a notebook or from another code file.\n",
    "We have already used a few modules like `math` in a way that illustrates one advantage: gathering Python functions and variables that can then be reused by variouys notebooks without reproducing the same code in each one.\n",

    "That will be useful when you have functions that you wish to use repeatedly within different tasks and from different notebooks or different Python code files; for example if you build a collection of Python functions for common linear algebra calculations."

    "\n",
    "To work with files of Python code and create moduels fo ue from witin notebooks, it is convenient to use a software tool that supports creating and editing such files and then running the code: a so-called *Integrated Development Environment*, or \"IDE\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For that task, these notes describe the use of [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [from \"Scientic PYthon Development enviRonment] which is included in Anaconda and can be opened from the Anaconda Navigator.\n",
    "However there are several other widely used alternatives, such as the fairly rudimentary [IDLE](https://realpython.com/python-idle/)\n",
    "and the more advanced [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)\n",
    "One reon for peferring Spyder over IDLE is that Spyder integrates the \"Scientific Python\" packages Numpy, Matlpotlib and Scipy that we will be using."

    "**Aside:** For more substantial Python code development, it can be better to first develop the code in a file like this, using Spyder (or another IDE), and then copy the working code into a notebook for presentation; that allows you to make use of more powerful testing and debugging tools.\n",

    "On the other hand, there is a potential drawback with putting the function definition and test cases in one Python file: if an error (\"exception\") occurs for any test case, the rest of the file is not executed.\n",
